Reasoning
We believe that the future of AI Data will heavily focus on data provenance, which will be the core to building the largest AI Data Markets, enabling AI-apps and a diverse ecosystem of AI Agents.

Furthermore, AI-applications, such as AI-agents, need trusted and validated access to data feeds and domain-specific intelligence. This problem needs significant advancement both on the coordination and trust layers. 

Rivalz DePIN   
The DePIN is a Chord/DHT-based P2P Node Network using Crystal-Kyber Algorithms for internal data encryption and FHE (blind computation) for external data-access creating a sudo-vector Database (RAG-enabled).  Learn More.

Rivalz DePIN focuses on:

Systems of data processing and augmentation <From Raw data to Structured Data>

Compliant, validated, structured Data and consensual personal Data Storage and Provenance <Static Data Markets for AI and Identity Licensing >

Data feeds Provenance <Enabling trusted data sources for Inference and AI Agents>

Intelligence pools Provenance <Enabling Markets of Modular Intelligence for AI Agents>

The Rivalz Network AI DePIN Layer consists of rNodes and Validator zNodes. Learn More.

Validator zNodes are used as a settlement solution for the inflows and outflows of Data from the DePIN Layer. Validator zNodes will be sold via the zNode Key Licence Sale. 

Light rClients allow users to contribute data space and limited compute from their devices. rClients are available for anyone to run.

Data Sourcing - Rivalz Collective-Validated organization will be able to submit data towards the Rivalz Data Market. Rivalz will also provide an in-house solution for personal data collection and open SDKs for third-parties to integrate with us.

Overtime Data aggregated on the Rivalz DePIN will enable ZATA - an ever-evolving, compliant, secure and decentralized AI Data Market. More details TBA.
